We presented the mechanical files we designed in the 'mechfile' fold, and some useful(maybe) reference files are presented in 'reference' folder. Noticed that the 'camera_damper_1-D435' and 'camera_damper_1-ZR300' are not used in this project, here we presented it only as a reference.


Details are shown as follow:
